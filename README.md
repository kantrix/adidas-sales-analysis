## Project Details:

**Insights and Key Metrics:-**

Profitability and Sales Performance: The maximum operating profit of $390,000 and a sum of total sales amounting to $900 Million highlight the company's strong financial performance. The operating margin of 0.80 indicates the efficiency of operations, especially in high-performing regions like the Northeast and West.

Regional Performance: The West region generated the highest total sales at $300 Million, reflecting strong market demand. In contrast, the Southeast region reported the lowest total sales at $100 Million, with a lower operating margin of $500, suggesting potential opportunities for growth or market strategy adjustments.

Sales by Retailer: Foot Locker achieved the highest price per unit ($125,000), indicating it is a premium retailer for Adidas products. On the other hand, Walmart had the lowest price per unit ($50,000), potentially representing more budget-conscious customers or a higher volume of sales at lower price points.

Sales Method Insights: Online sales led in both price per unit ($200,000) and units sold (939,000 units), making up 37.88% of total sales, reflecting a strong trend toward e-commerce. Meanwhile, in-store sales contributed to the highest total sales ($356.64 Million) despite having a lower price per unit ($100,000), emphasizing the continued significance of brick-and-mortar retail.

Monthly Trends: Sales activity was highest in August, with the greatest number of sales methods being employed. Conversely, April saw the lowest sales volume, suggesting seasonal fluctuations or potential areas for marketing focus during slower months.

Conclusions:-
The report reveals Adidas's overall positive sales performance, but highlights areas for improvement. By focusing on optimizing sales in the Midwest region, exploring new retail channels, enhancing in-store experiences, and capitalizing on peak months, Adidas can further strengthen its market position.

Recommendations:-
Increase Sales in the Midwest Region: Analyze the reasons for the low sales in the Midwest and implement strategies to improve performance in this region.

Explore New Retail Channels: To further increase market share, consider expanding into new retail channels like e-commerce platforms and mobile apps.

Optimize In-Store Sales: Enhance the in-store shopping experience to increase sales through this channel.

Capitalize on Peak Months: Develop marketing campaigns and promotions to maximize sales during peak months like August, September, and January.
